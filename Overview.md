# Bike Bottle Design Overview
## Introduction 
Portable devices which can detect airbourne particulates are finding its way into current consumer markets. Unlike there bulky, stationary counterparts the small scale nature of such sensors feeds into a more user friendly, hazzle free platform. The current document proposes such a portable device designed to be fit within a bike bottle housing. Particulate matter is linked with a number of negative health outcomes. Such links are to be addressed with the use of the propesed device.


### Design Specifications  

#### Absolute Necessities 
1. Main Housing:
 - The enclosed device should fit a bike bottle housing.

2. OPC Sensor: 
 - Must have the Alhpa Sense OPC-N3 <br/>
